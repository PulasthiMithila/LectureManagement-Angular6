Lectures Schedule and Data Management System for the university
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I began this project with the aim of giving a solution for a existing problem within the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. I limited my scope to the  department of Computing And Information System faculty of Applied Sciences . Within the department there is no any proper way to manage and get the details of the lectures conducted , lecture halls booked and free time slots available for the department. Adding  a new lecture is a headache for the department representative because finding free time for the department , lecture and getting information about lecture halls is too much difficult. I started this project with the aim of giving a proper solution for this problem.
###  Main Task

1. The system should give a clear view of 
      - free time slots available for the respective year according to the time table 
  
      - how the lecture halls are booked within the department 

      - how the lectures time slots are arranged

within the week and in the upcoming week.

2. Admin should have the ability to adding and canceling lectures.When adding a new lecture

     - System should filter the timetable, lecture halls availability ,lectures schedule   and   give free time slots that available for adding new lectures.
  
     - And when adding/canceling  the lectures, lecturer and the representative of the respective year should  gets a notification.

3. Students can view the updated time tables and notice board (Angular PWA ).

### Sub Task
1. The system consits of
    - Admin login.
    - Admin can keep track of student , lecture details.
    - Generating reports of the conducted lectures based on the week.
    - Chatting and emailing system to contact with lectures.
    - Admin can publish informations on the notice board.
    - Keep records regarding the events conducted within the department.
    - Developing a real time notification system for subscribed students.
